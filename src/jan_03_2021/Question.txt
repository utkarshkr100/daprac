Question.1
Singly Linked Lists
Basic Operations on a List
• Traversing the list
• Inserting an item in the list
• Deleting an item from the list

Singly Linked List Insertion
Insertion into a singly-linked list has three cases:
• Inserting a new node before the head (at the beginning)
• Inserting a new node after the tail (at the end of the list)
• Inserting a new node at the middle of the list (random location)

Singly Linked List Deletion
Similar to insertion, here we also have three cases.
• Deleting the first node
• Deleting the last node
• Deleting an intermediate node.

Deletion by Keys(Search the data in the linked list)
• Deleting the first node
• Deleting the last node
• Deleting an intermediate node.


Question.2
Same for Doubly Linked List.
