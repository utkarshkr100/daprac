Q1.Implement HashMap

Q2.Given an array of characters, give an algorithm for removing the duplicates.
  -Use time complexity o(n^2) without hashing. 
  https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/
  //its not on character but on Integers but same Questions.

Q3.Sort and use to get in o(nlogn) time complexity.

Q4.Do with hashing in o(n) time complexity.

Q5.Given two arrays of unordered numbers, check whether both arrays have the same
set of numbers?

Q6.Can we improve the time complexity of Problem-5?
    Solution: Yes. To improve the time complexity, let us assume that we have sorted both the lists.
    Since the sizes of both arrays are n, we need O(n log n) time for sorting them. After sorting, we
    just need to scan both the arrays with two pointers and see whether they point to the same element
    every time, and keep moving the pointers until we reach the end of the arrays.

Q7. use hashing for Question 5.
