Q1.Implement HashMap

Q2.Given an array of characters, give an algorithm for removing the duplicates.
  -Use time complexity o(n^2) without hashing. 
  https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/
  //its not on character but on Integers but same Questions.

Q3.Sort and use to get in o(nlogn) time complexity.

Q4.Do with hashing in o(n) time complexity.

Q5.Given two arrays of unordered numbers, check whether both arrays have the same
set of numbers?

Q6.Can we improve the time complexity of Problem-5?
    Solution: Yes. To improve the time complexity, let us assume that we have sorted both the lists.
    Since the sizes of both arrays are n, we need O(n log n) time for sorting them. After sorting, we
    just need to scan both the arrays with two pointers and see whether they point to the same element
    every time, and keep moving the pointers until we reach the end of the arrays.

Q7. use hashing for Question 5.

Q8.Given a list of number pairs; if pair(i,j) exists, and pair(j,i) exists, report all such
pairs. For example, in {{1,3},{2,6},{3,5},{7,4},{5,3},{8,7}}, we see that {3,5} and
{5,3} are present. Report this pair when you encounter {5,3}. We call such pairs
‘symmetric pairs’. So, give an efficient algorithm for finding all such pairs.

Q9.Given a singly linked list, check whether it has a loop in it or not.
Solution: Using Hash Tables.
//to ask Utkarsh what is node address in linked list

Q10. Given an array of 101 elements. Out of them 50 elements are distinct, 24
elements are repeated 2 times, and one element is repeated 3 times. Find the element that is
repeated 3 times in O(1).

Q11. Given m sets of integers that have n elements in them, provide an algorithm to
find an element which appeared in the maximum number of sets?

Q 12.Given two sets A and B, and a number K, Give an algorithm for finding whether
there exists a pair of elements, one from A and one from B, that add up to K.

Q 13. Give an algorithm to remove the specified characters from a given string which
are given in another string?

Q14. Give an algorithm for finding the first non-repeated character in a string. For
example, the first non-repeated character in the string “abzddab” is ‘z’.

Q 15.Can we improve the time complexity of 0(n)?

Q 16. Given a string, give an algorithm for finding the first repeating letter in a string?

Q 17. Given an array of n numbers, create an algorithm which displays all pairs
whose sum is S.
